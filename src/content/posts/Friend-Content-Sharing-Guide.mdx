# Friend Content Sharing

Connect your blog with others and create a network of shared content with our new friend content sharing feature. This guide covers everything you need to know about setting up friend connections, sharing content, and building a mini social network with your static Astro site.

## What is Friend Content Sharing?

Friend Content Sharing is a new feature that allows you to:

- Connect your blog with other blogs running the same platform
- Share your content with others
- Display content from your friends' blogs within your site
- Create a distributed social network of content without a central server

Think of it as a decentralized feed reader built directly into your blog. When you log in as the site admin, you can see content from blogs you've connected with, while regular visitors still see just your content.

## Accessing Friend Content Features

All friend content features are available in the `/friends` section of your site. This page is restricted to site administrators only, so you'll need to log in to access it.

### Authentication

To access the Friends page:

1. Navigate to `/friends` in your browser
2. You'll be presented with a login screen
3. Enter your admin credentials (username and password)
4. Once authenticated, you'll see the Content Sharing Hub

> **Note**: If you're already logged in, you'll be taken directly to the Content Sharing Hub.

## The Content Sharing Hub

The Content Sharing Hub is divided into three main sections:

### 1. Share Your Content

This section allows you to create a content package that you can share with others. Options include:

- **Blog Posts**: Include your published blog posts
- **Timeline Events**: Include your timeline data (if applicable)
- **Site Configuration**: Share your site settings (use with caution)
- **Media Assets**: Include images and other media files

To share your content:

1. Select the content types you want to include
2. Click "Create & Download Package"
3. Share the downloaded JSON file with others

### 2. Import Content

This section allows you to import content from other blogs. To import content:

1. Click on the upload area to select a package file
2. Once uploaded, select which content types to import
3. Click "Import Content" to add the content to your site

> **Best Practice**: When importing content, the system will automatically try to create a friend connection to the source blog, making future content sharing easier.

### 3. Connected Friends

This is where you manage your friend connections. From here, you can:

- Add new friends by providing their site details
- View existing connections
- Sync content from specific friends
- Remove friend connections
- Configure content integration settings

## Adding New Friends

To add a new friend connection:

1. In the "Add New Friend" section, provide:
   - **Friend Name**: The name of the blog or its author
   - **Site URL**: The complete URL to the friend's blog
   - **Bio** (optional): A short description
   - **Avatar URL** (optional): Link to a profile image
2. Click "Add Friend"

Once added, the system will automatically attempt to sync content from the friend's site. You'll see a loading indicator during this process.

### Manual vs. Automatic Connections

There are two ways to create friend connections:

1. **Manual**: Add a friend by entering their details as described above
2. **Automatic**: When you import a content package, the system can automatically create a connection to the source blog

## Managing Friend Content

### Syncing Content

Content from your friends isn't updated automatically. You need to manually sync to see their latest posts:

- Click the sync button on an individual friend card to update just that friend's content
- Use the "Sync All Friends" button to update content from all connected friends at once

### Content Integration

By default, friend content appears in your main feed when you're logged in. You can control this with the "Enable Friend Content in Main Feed" option.

When enabled:
- Friend content appears at the top of your homepage when you're logged in
- Content is clearly labeled with the friend's name and avatar
- Regular visitors still only see your content

### Viewing Friend Content

Friend content appears in two places:

1. **Homepage Feed**: A selection of recent friend posts appear at the top of your homepage when logged in
2. **Individual Posts**: You can view the full content of individual friend posts

When viewing friend content, you'll see:
- Attribution to the original author
- The date it was published
- A link to view the original post on the friend's site

## Technical Details

For developers and advanced users, here are some technical details about how the system works:

- Friend data is stored in your browser's localStorage
- Content is cached to minimize unnecessary network requests
- The system attempts to fetch content in several ways:
  1. First tries a JSON feed at `/api/posts.json`
  2. Falls back to parsing sitemap.xml
  3. Can extract content from HTML if necessary
- Friend content is rendered client-side using Svelte components
- Authentication uses a simple username/password system stored in localStorage

## Best Practices

For the best experience with friend content sharing:

1. **Request permission** before adding someone's blog as a friend
2. **Keep your content updated** by regularly syncing with friends
3. **Be selective** about which friends you add to avoid content overload
4. **Provide complete information** when adding friends for better organization
5. **Check compatibility** - this feature works best when both sites use the same platform

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't I see friend content on my homepage?**
A: Make sure you're logged in and have "Enable Friend Content in Main Feed" checked in the Friends page.

**Q: Why isn't content syncing from a friend's site?**
A: The friend's site may not expose content in a way our system can access. Ask them to use the Content Package feature to share content directly.

**Q: Can visitors see my friends list?**
A: No, the friends list and friend content are only visible to authenticated administrators.
