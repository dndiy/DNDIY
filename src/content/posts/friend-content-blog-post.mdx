# Friend Content Sharing

The Friend Content Sharing system allows blogs built with our framework to connect and share content with each other, creating a decentralized network of related blogs. When you add a friend's blog, your site will automatically fetch and display their content in your feed when you're logged in, while regular visitors continue to see just your content.

## How It Works

Unlike traditional social networks that require a central server, our Friend Content Sharing works directly between blogs:

1. **Connect with friends** by adding their blog URL to your friends list
2. **Content is automatically fetched** from their site and displayed in your feed
3. **You control the experience** - visitors see only your content, you see both
4. **No central authority** - connections are direct between blogs

## Setting Up Friend Sharing

Friend sharing is **enabled by default** on all blogs built with our framework. During the build process, a special `friend-content.json` file is automatically generated in your public directory, which contains information about your blog and your recent posts.

However, for this to work properly across different domains, you need to set up CORS headers based on your hosting platform.

### GitHub Pages

If you're hosting on GitHub Pages, add a file named `_headers` to your repository root:

```
# Set CORS headers for the friend-content.json file
/friend-content.json
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

### Netlify

For Netlify hosting, create a `netlify.toml` file in your repository root:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/friend-content.json"
  [headers.values]
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods = "GET"
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers = "Content-Type"
```

### Vercel

If you're using Vercel, add a `vercel.json` file to your repository root:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/friend-content.json",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "*"
        },
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
          "value": "GET"
        },
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
          "value": "Content-Type"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Other Hosting Providers

For other hosting providers, you'll need to add the following HTTP headers to requests for `/friend-content.json`:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

Check your hosting provider's documentation for how to add custom headers to specific files.

## Using Friend Content Sharing

### Adding a Friend's Blog

Once you've set up CORS headers, you can start connecting with other blogs:

1. Log in to your blog as an administrator
2. Navigate to the `/friends` page
3. Enter your friend's blog name and URL
4. Click "Add Friend"

The system will automatically validate the site and try to fetch content. If the friend's site also uses our framework (with the `friend-content.json` file), their content will be immediately available in your feed.

### Managing Friend Content

The Friends page gives you complete control over your connections:

- **Sync content** to get the latest posts from your friends
- **Toggle visibility** to control whether friend content appears in your feed
- **Remove friends** if you no longer want to see their content

### Viewing Friend Content

When logged in as an administrator, friend content will appear:

1. At the top of your main feed
2. Clearly labeled with the friend's name and site
3. With links to view the original post on their site

Regular visitors to your site will only see your content, maintaining your site's focus.

## Tips for Building Your Network

1. **Connect with blogs in your niche** to create a relevant content ecosystem
2. **Regularly sync content** to keep your feed fresh with new posts
3. **Add descriptive friend names** to help you identify content sources
4. **Share your site URL** with other blog owners using our framework
5. **Check the "Last synced"** timestamp to see when content was last updated

## For Developers: Technical Details

### Content File Format

The `friend-content.json` file follows this structure:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "name": "Blog Name",
    "description": "Blog description",
    "url": "https://myblog.com",
    "owner": "Blog Owner",
    "avatar": "/images/avatar.jpg"
  },
  "cors": true,
  "version": "1.0",
  "generated": "2025-03-27T12:00:00Z",
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "post-1",
      "title": "Post Title",
      "slug": "post-slug",
      "description": "Post description",
      "published": "2025-03-20T09:00:00Z",
      "content": "<p>Post content preview...</p>",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fallback Methods

If a site doesn't have the `friend-content.json` file, the system tries these methods in order:

1. Look for a JSON feed at `/api/posts.json`
2. Try to parse an RSS feed at `/rss.xml`
3. Attempt to scrape the homepage for blog links
4. Provide a fallback "site exists" post if all else fails

This gives the system flexibility to work with many different types of blogs, even those not using our framework.

## Privacy and Security

Friend Content Sharing respects privacy and security:

- Content is only shared with sites that explicitly add your blog as a friend
- No personal data is included in the shared content
- You control exactly which blogs you connect with
- Regular visitors never see content from connected blogs
- You can remove connections at any time

## Getting Started Today

To start building your network of connected blogs:

1. Add the appropriate CORS headers for your hosting platform
2. Share your blog URL with other users of our framework
3. Visit the `/friends` page to start adding connections

With Friend Content Sharing, you're not just creating a blogâ€”you're joining a network of connected content creators sharing ideas across the web.
